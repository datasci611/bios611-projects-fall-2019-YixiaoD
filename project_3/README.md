# Project 3

## Backgrounds
UMD's Community Shelter provides a shelter for homeless individuals and families. By offering case management and workforce development, it also helps people end homeless and provides them with a future.

## Project description
To run the entire project:  
```
make results/report.html
```
In this project, I want to find how does length of stay relate to local rent price and job market. The data folder contains the data frames used in this project. The scripts folder contains the R script for visualization and the python script for data wrangling. The results folder contains the output data frames, plots and the report.Rmd which generates the report.html.

## Data sources
A bunch of data tables are provided by UMD.  
The following data frames are used:  
CLIENT_191102.tsv.  
ENTRY_EXIT_191102.tsv.  
Unemployment rate in Durham (from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DURH537URN.  
Average rent price for 1 bed in Durham https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-durham-rent-trends/


## Conclusion
In general the length of stay has little relationship with the unemployment rate. But it has a positive relationship with the local price. The higher the local price is, people are likely to stay longer.
