# Backgrounds
UMD(Urban Ministries of Durham) is a non-profit orgnization which connects with the community to end homelessness and fight  poverty by offering food, shelter and a future to neighbors in need. This project is designed to dig into the data provided by  UMD and find something valuable for the staff who are working for the orgnization.

# Project description

# Data sources
