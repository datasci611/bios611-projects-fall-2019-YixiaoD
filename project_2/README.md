#### Background
[Urban Ministries of Durham](http://umdurham.org/) (UMD) in an non-profit organization helping end homelessness in the neighborhood for decades. The intended audience for this project is primarily those working with or at UMD. 

#### Purpose
In this project, I want to help UMD staff to discover the data they provided. In the chart session, they can see how many records of different type are there in each year or in each month of a selected year. In the raw data session, they can see the raw data table.

##### Data
Raw data provided by the UMD includes 79,838 records with 18 variables and 15,352 distinct Client ID Numbers. Variables describe dates, food pounds, bus tickets, clothing, financial assistance, diaper, hygiene kits, and school supplies kits. The dataset is given in the *data* folder.

#### Scripts
* app.R contains code for the Rshiny user interface and server. 
* helper.R contains data cleaning code and 'helper functions' to support the Shiny app.
