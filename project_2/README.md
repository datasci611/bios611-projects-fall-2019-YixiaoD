# Purpose
In this project, I want to help UMD staff to discover the data they provided. I already complete chart 1 and chart 2. In chart 1, they can select the year to see how many visit are there in each month of that year. In chart 2, they can select the type of aids to see how many visits for that type of aid are there in each year.
