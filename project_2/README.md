#### Purpose
In this project, I want to help UMD staff to discover the data they provided. I already complete chart 1 and chart 2. In chart 1, they can select the year to see how many visit are there in each month of that year. In chart 2, they can select the type of aids to see how many visits for that type of aid are there in each year.  


##### Data
Raw data provided by the UMD includes 79,838 records with 18 variables and 15,352 distinct Client ID Numbers. Variables describe dates, food pounds, bus tickets, clothing, financial assistance, diaper, hygiene kits, and school supplies kits. The dataset is given in the *data* folder.

#### Scripts
